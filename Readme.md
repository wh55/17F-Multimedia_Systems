## Project: 3D Robot Control in a 3D Scene Generated from RGB-D Image
C++ / OpenCV / PCL (Point Cloud Library) / Ubuntu / C# / Unity3D / Desktop Application

The project is to to use a RGB-D dataset to visualize a 3D scene, and then render a robot model in this scene. We can control the robot to make it move to a marker position. The robot will be made animated and will be with sound effects when moving.

This project is a comprehensive project and involves many different tools and concepts at once, including: C++, C#, OpenCV, Point Cloud Library, Ubuntu System, CMake, MeshLab,
